This is a collection of various PHP experiments.

    * DBQuery- "Interesting" database interfacing. For more information
      visit http://zaemis.blogspot.com/2009/01/database-access.html

    * Fibonacci- A lazily-iterable list of Fibonacci numbers which also
      supports random array access. For more information visit
      http://zaemis.tumblr.com/post/6179755099/lazy-fibonacci-array

    * PhoneSpelling- A script that outputs all of the possible letter
      combinations that a given phone number could represent. Mapping is
      done via SQL rather than traditional recursion.

    * Random String- An intentionally over-engineered random string generator.
